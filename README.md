This prepsentation is used every year to discuss with graduate students and postdocs about the importance of Data Visualization. It is meant to be a way to get them to start thinking about the design of your figures in a different way, hopefully pushing them to study the subject of information design and make better figures for their science. Perhaps this might be usedful for you as well.

The material found in this presentation is taken or inspired by numerous sources, including the [Junk Charts blog](https://junkcharts.typepad.com), the Nature Methods collection [“Point of View”](http://go.nature.com/3nDvUlp) by Wong and Krzywinski, the article "Ten simple rules for better figures" by [Rougier et al. 2014 in Plos Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) and the [IPCC Visual Style Guide 2018](https://bit.ly/37Az9of) by by Gomis and Pidcock. 

Additionally, I have used the glab_theme we use as a strandard theme in my laboratory to plot figures with ggplot2. You can find the code for the customized themplate at [Glab_ggplot2_theme repository](https://github.com/giovannellilab/GLab_ggplot2_theme).
